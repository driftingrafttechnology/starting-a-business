# Web Creation


You'll want a website hosted under your domain name to at the very least tell the world about your company, what you do, and how to contact you to conduct business.
You might also want other web applications or services running.
	- Internal website for employees
	    - Project Mangement Software
	    - Timekeeping Software
	    - Publishing company policies and news
	- Web Store for e-commerce
Everything public facing (and even internal) websites should be carefully designed to be easy to use and nice to look at.
After designing wireframes, the next descision is the technology stack to use.

## Creating a public static website
- This type of website is one that displays the same content to every user.
- This is the cheapest to run because it only consists of unchanging files.
- Can be written in plain HTML, CSS, and/or Javascript, but more commonly a static site generator (SSG) is used. There are many others in addition to the ones listed below.
    - Javascript
    	- Next.js/React
	- VuePress
	- Gatsby
	- Nuxt
    - Ruby
    	- Jekyll
	- Slate
    - Go
    	- Hugo

## Creating a dynamic website
- This is a type of website that users can interact with.
- Will cost more to run and develop because it will need a database (sometimes in addition to other services).
- These can be broken down into a few different categories:
	- E-commerce
	    - A store with the ability to list products and take payments.
	- Customer Relationship Management
	    - Internally used software to track business information.
	- Content Management System
	    - A website that can be easily edited by someone in the company without requiring additional developer work.
