# Domain Registration

- Domains and DNS are like a yellow-pages for the internet. DNS records translate human things like `your-business.com` into computer things like the IP address your business website is hosted at.
- You need to buy the domain that you'd like from a domain registrar
	- Ex. Namecheap, GoDaddy
- You can have the registrar host your DNS records, or you can host them somewhere else
	- For $0.50/month you can host your zone in AWS Route 53
