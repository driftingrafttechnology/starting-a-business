# E-mail
- Crucial to business communication
- Unless you want to hire an email administration team, you should use an email hosting service
- To prevent your emails from being marked as __spam__, it's important to set up DKIM and SPF for your email. [Why?](dns_records.md)
	- These are DNS records that are used to verify your email domain
	- These records are important in preventing your emails from getting trapped in the spam filters of the recipient
- If you plan on sending mass emails (ex. for a marketing campaign) you should also use a service for this
